# Morse-Code
A string to morse code converter made with ❤️ in Python

How it works?

1. Enter your string as text in the command line
2. The program takes the input and for every character searches for the appropriate Morse Code in the embedded CSV file
3. Then it joins it to an empty string and prints the output

Feel free to do any changes following the lisence requirements. Enjoy
