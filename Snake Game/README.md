# Snake-Game
The famous snake game made with ❤️ in Python!

The game starts with a small snake and a food item, probably thats an apple, but snakes dont eat apples,right?
Never mind. After the game starts you can move the snake by arrow keys as in any standard game and you have to eat the food.
One point is awarded for every food item eaten and a new food item is found at a different place.
Your goal is to make the highest score!
But be sure not to colllide with your own tail or the wall, which will lead to an instant "Game Over!"

Happy Playing! See if you can beat the world record of 252 points in this game 😉
